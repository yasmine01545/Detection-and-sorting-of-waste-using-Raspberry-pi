 # Abstract   

This end-of-year project report in artificial intelligence focuses on the computer vision technique for the classification of waste into recycling categories, which could be an effective way to treat waste.
The libraries used to develop machine learning methods are Keras and tensorflow.
The objective of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to take images and classify them into six classes consisting of glass, paper, metal, plastic, cardboard and trash.
We also create a dataset containing approximately 400 to 500 images collected via the internet.
