# Detection-and-sorting-of-waste-using-Raspberry-pi
 # Description  

This end-of-year project in artificial intelligence focuses on the computer vision technique for the classification of waste into recycling categories, which could be an effective way to treat waste.
The libraries used to develop machine learning methods are Keras and tensorflow.
The objective of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to take images and classify them into six classes consisting of glass, paper, metal, plastic, cardboard and trash.
We also create a dataset containing approximately 400 to 500 images collected via the internet.

The system consists of sorting the waste received on a conveyor belt and classifying it according to 5 categories:
namely plastic, glass, paper, steel and other waste (vegetable, food, etc.).
As shown in Figure 1, this system includes a camera that captures images of the waste present on the treadmill. These images will then be analyzed and analyzed in real time through a Raspberry Pi 4 card on which is deposited automatic image processing software based on deep neural networks (deep learning). This software makes it possible to classify the images and to control the scrapers to direct and properly route the waste to the various reception bins (plastic, glass, paper, metal and others).
